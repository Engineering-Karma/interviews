#### Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, find the indices of two numbers in `nums` such that 
their sum equals `target`. You may assume that each input has exactly one valid solution, and you cannot use 
the same element twice.

#### Examples
Input: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`  
Output: `[0, 1]`, because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`

#### Constraints
- Each input has exactly one solution.
- The same element cannot be used twice.
- The answer can be returned in any order.
