Food delivery companies employ tens of thousands of delivery drivers who each submit hundreds of deliveries per week.
Delivery details are automatically sent to the system immediately after the delivery. Delivery drivers have different
hourly payment rates, depending on their performance. Drivers can take on, and be paid for, multiple deliveries
simultaneously. If a driver is paid $10.00 per hour, and a delivery takes 1 hour and 30 minutes, the driver is paid $15.00
for that delivery. We are building a dashboard to show a single number - the total cost of all deliveries - on screens
in the accounting department offices.
