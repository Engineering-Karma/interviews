Two Sum
- [v1. Base Problem](../../../coding/two-sum/v1.md "Given an array of integers nums and an integer `target`, find the indices of two numbers in nums such that their sum equals target. You may assume that each input has exactly one valid solution, and you cannot use the same element twice.")  
- [v2. Unique Pairs](../../../coding/two-sum/v2.md "Given an integer array nums and an integer target, find the number of in the array whose sum equals the target.
- Each pair should be counted only once.
- The order of elements in a pair does not matter (i.e., [1][5] and [5][1] are considered the same pair).
- Duplicate pairs must not be counted multiple times.")
