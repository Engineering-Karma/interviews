Two Sum
- [v1 - Base Problem](../../../coding/two-sum/v1.md "Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, find the indices of two numbers in nums such that their sum equals target. You may assume that each input has exactly one valid solution, and you cannot use the same element twice.")
- [v2. Unique Pairs](../../../coding/two-sum/v2.md "Given an integer array nums and an integer target, find the number of in the array whose sum equals the target.
Each pair should be counted only once.
The order of elements in a pair does not matter (i.e., [1][5] and [5][1] are considered the same pair).
Duplicate pairs must not be counted multiple times.")  
- [v3. Multiple Pairs](../../../coding/two-sum/v3.md "Given an integer array nums and an integer target, find all pairs of numbers in the array whose sum equals the target. Unlike the unique pairs variation, here:
You should return all pairs, including duplicates if they exist.
The pairs can be returned in any order.
Each pair consists of two elements whose sum is target.
The same element may be used in multiple pairs but not twice in the same pair.")
